## Projects:
#### - MIPS Dissasembler
This program takes in an array of 32 bit hex instuctions and converts them to human-readable MIPS assembly language.
#### - Cache Simulator
This program simulates a 16x16 byte cache as a Java class.  The class has functions to read or write to a specific address the cache, or display the contents.  Each of the 16 cache slots is also a Java class, which has values a "valid bit, dirty bit", "slot number", and "tag bit", in addition to an array to hold 16 bytes of data.
#### - Pipelined Processor
This program simulates a 5-stage pipeline for 32-bit instructions.  An array of 32 bit instructions are passed through the pipeline, and execute on the 32 data registers.  At the end of each clock cycle, the values of the data registers are displayed.
